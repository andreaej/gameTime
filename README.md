Code Crusher Project for CIS123

## Aim 
In this project, you will create a match three game similar to Candy Crush or Bejeweled. You will have 3 milestones to help you complete the activity. 

### Objectives
By the end of this project you will: 
- Be familiar with multidimensional lists 
- Have used and manipulated multidimensional lists
- Created and manipulated existing functions
- Add code to an existing repository

***Timing***
In total, you will have 4 weeks to complete this project. The first 3 weeks will be dedicated to implementing the project itself and the final week will be used for code reviews. 

### Description
Bejeweled and Candy Crush are examples of match-three games. The goal in such games is to swap
adjacent game pieces to form horizontal or vertical lines consisting of three or more identical pieces.
Some swap three games also include additional game mechanics such as power-ups that clear multiple
pieces from the game board, specific goals that must be fulfilled to pass a level, and time constraints,
among others.

In this assignment you will add functionality to codeCrusher â€“ a computer programming themed matchthree game. I have written all of the user interface code (graphics and mouse) for the game, as well as
some of the game logic, and I have created all of the necessary art assets. Your task is to write the
functions that implement the remaining aspects of the game logic, resulting in a fully functional game.
These functions are described in the following sections. Note that you must follow the implementation
instructions exactly. If your function has a different name, takes a different number of parameters, or
returns a different value than expected then my code will not be able to call it successfully, and the
game will not work.
